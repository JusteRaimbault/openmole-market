# Calibration of a NetLogo model

This market entry calibrates the [Ants](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants) NetLogo model with an Evolutionary/Genetic Algorithm (EA/GA) in OpenMOLE. It proposes 2 aproach, the first on uses a generationnal NSGA2 which is very classical. The second one is better fit for distributed computing and uses an [island model](http://www.gustafsonresearch.com/thesis_html/node105.html) distribution strategy.
